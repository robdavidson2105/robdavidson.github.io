Provided infrastructure consulting services to TD Direct Investing (TDDI).   In preparation for sale of the business, I assisted TDDI separate their infrastructure services from their Canadian parent company TD Bank.  Then subsequently assisted with the integration of IT services with Interactive Investor following their acquition of TDDI.

This involved: 
* selecting, designing, and implementing a new MPLS WAN service covering TDDI's office and datacentre locations;
* setting up a new Microsoft Enterprise agreement, along with migration from on-premise Exchange to Office 365;
* migration of firewall management services from group to local control; 
* selecting and migrating to a new DDoS service provider (F5 Silverline); and
* on-boarding new locations and infrastructure support from Interactive Investor's IT function.
