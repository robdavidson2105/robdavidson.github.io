As Head of Strategic IT Change, my role included governing the design of the company's insurance broking re-platform solution. I was the chief architect during the IT solution delivery and managed the safe landing of a number of peripheral solutions to the main packaged application provided by CDL.

This included: the introduction of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) using software from Blue Prism; and the implementation of Real-Time Process Optimisation (RTPO) software from NICE Systems.

The combination of RPA and RTPO generated savings over Â£3m and removed reliance on 3rd party software suppliers for most application process changes.
