I led Swinton’s software development function supporting all our line-of-business applications through 160 software engineers and managers.

During this time we:

* delivered 1st phase of sales platform replacement as part of company-wide transformation programme – reduced end-to- end sales time from 47 mins to 29 mins and achieved first major milestone in decommissioning legacy systems;
* scaled up team with 40+ contract resource and designed an Agile at Scale approach across 13 distinct feature squads. Allowed us to support aggressive transformation timescales – ultimately leading to successful delivery of the 1st phase;
* delivered in-house developed eCommerce web site plus third-party managed marketing content. Through responsive design and attention to UX we improved tablet and smart-phone conversion rates in line with consumer trends;
* delivered new platform for real-time pricing allowing retail pricing and discounting models to be deployed within minutes instead of days;
* eradicated deployment outages through more extensive automated testing and automated deployment pipeline;
* introduced greater collaboration and transparency through team-wide adoption of Jira and Confluence; and 
* responsible for setting and managing £18m budget across internal resources and third party contracts.
