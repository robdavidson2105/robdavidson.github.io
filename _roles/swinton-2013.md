I led Swinton’s software development function supporting all our line-of-business applications through 160 software engineers and managers.

During this time:

* Delivered 1st phase of sales platform replacement as part of company-wide transformation programme – reduced end-to- end sales time from 47 mins to 29 mins and achieved first major milestone in decommissioning legacy systems.
* Scaled up team with 40+ contract resource and designed an Agile at Scale approach across 13 distinct feature squads. Allowed us to support aggressive transformation timescales – ultimately leading to successful delivery of the 1st phase.
* Delivered in-house developed eCommerce web site plus third-party managed marketing content. Through responsive design and attention to UX we improved tablet and smart-phone conversion rates in line with consumer trends.
* Delivered new platform for real-time pricing allowing retail pricing and discounting models to be deployed within minutes instead of days.
* Eradicated deployment outages through more extensive automated testing and automated deployment pipeline.
* Introduced greater collaboration and transparency through team-wide adoption of Jira and Confluence.
* Responsible for setting and managing £18m budget across internal resources and third party contracts.
