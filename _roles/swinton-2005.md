* iproved branch availability by migrating from SCO Unix to Red Hat Unix – using innovative features within Red Hat;
* innovated with supplier to replace tape backups in remote offices with central NetApp backups. Reduced backup time from 3 hours to 15 mins – first implementation of its kind across Europe; and
