Qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Coopers & Lybrand (now PwC).   I specialised in IT assurance before moving to an IT internal audit role at Littlewoods Group (now Shop Direct).

Then in 1997, I moved to an IT analyst role at Swinton Insurance - primarily working on Finance System related solutions.  During this time I was lead analyst on our successful SAP R/3 implementation as well as a number of other packaged software solutions.

Following this, staying within Swinton Insurance I moved into various IT line management roles, starting in 2002 as Technical Services Manager.
