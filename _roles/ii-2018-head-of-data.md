Defining Data Strategy, technology solution, operating model, and execution plan to transform Interactive Investor's (ii) data capabilities.

So far my team has:

* worked with consulting partners and developed a Data Strategy and Roadmap;
* evaluated technology options and selected a combination of cloud services to provide our modern data architecture (Talend for ETL, Amazon S3 + Snowflake for Data Lake and Mart, and PowerBI for visualisation and reporting);
* implemented our new data platform and commenced migration; and
* worked with 3rd parties to accelerate predictive analytics capabilities.

The journey continues ...
