# Privacy Policy

The TraceAR app was developed by Rob Davidson as stand-alone software to run on your iPhone or iPad device.

I do not collect, use, save, or have access to any or your personal data which may be recorded in TraceAR.   You may have permitted access to your photo library but this is only to allow you to use a photo to trace.  I don't process that information at all and have no access to it.  

You may revoke access to your photo library within your IOS privacy settings.

# Log Data

If the TraceAR app crashes then you can submit log data (through Apple's service) which may contain information such as your device's IP address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app, the time and date, and other statistics.

This data is used for troubleshooting software issues and is not retained.
