# AWS Training
If you haven't already found it, you should try out the AWS Training site.   In particular, there's a great [Data Scientist's track](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learning-paths/machine-learning/data-scientist/).

If nothing else, for rusty mathematicians like me, the 'Math**s** for Machine Learning' course is great.  A really good refresher on probability theory and great overview of univariate and multivariate calculus ... essential for understanding what's going on with gradient descent.

Also this track includes a really good summary explanation of stochastic gradient descent and the fundamentals of linear and logistic regression.

Once you've finished the grounding courses (not too onerous - you should complete them in a couple of weekends) then learning to program a chatbot is pretty cool.   Its a an eye-opener as to how evolved speech recognition and speech synthesis has become.

I jumped over the guided lab-session and instead built a chatbot integrated with the AWS Connect call centre service ... very geeky and cool - I'll post more details about this later.
