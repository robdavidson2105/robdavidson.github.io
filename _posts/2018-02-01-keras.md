# Keras
Given that Keras is a high level API and can sit on top of machine learning libraries (such as Tensorflow) - then it seems like a logical choice to adopt it.

I referenced TFLearn a while ago - that's an abstraction of Tensorflow - primarily aimed at helping you learn the ropes - don't think it was intended for anything further that.

So now we're getting a bit more serious - it's time to invest some time learning how to use Keras.

There's a ton of material to get you started with Keras:  [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/) is a great site.   [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/about/) has selflessly developed the site and it's got some awesome examples to get you started.

The [Keras website](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/) itself has a load of examples in the documentation section too - I just found Jason's site a little easier to digest.

OK here goes ...
