# Standing on the shoulders of giants
So now you've completed Andrew Ng's machine learning and you understand how to build neural networks from scratch.

Now it's time to benefit from the efforts of others and use some abstraction layers to shortcut some of the heavy lifting.   Enter TFLearn - using this library you can build your first neural network in a matter of minutes ... or however long it takes you to work out all the Python and Tensorflow dependencies!

I built my first neural network using TFLearn with the Titanic example they have in the quickstart tutorial: [TFLearn Quickstart](http://tflearn.org/tutorials/quickstart.html)

# DiCaprio
Once you've trained the model then you'll be able to predict whether Kate Winslett and Leonardo DiCaprio are likely to survive - based on their steerage and class.

*Spoiler Alert* 

DiCaprio doesn't make it!
