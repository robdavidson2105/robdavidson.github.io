# Markowitz’s Efficient Frontier
Working for a stock broker, it would be remiss of me not to look at Markowitz's modern portfolio theory.

I won't regurgitate what's already been written - I'll just help you find it...

So a couple of key articles worth a read are by [Bernard Brenyah](https://medium.com/@bbrenyah) and they are:

* [Markowitz’s Efficient Frontier in Python [Part 1/2]](https://medium.com/python-data/effient-frontier-in-python-34b0c3043314)
* [Efficient Frontier & Portfolio Optimization with Python [Part 2/2]](https://medium.com/python-data/efficient-frontier-portfolio-optimization-with-python-part-2-2-2fe23413ad94)

And this posting by [Ricky Kim](https://towardsdatascience.com/@rickykim78) has a end-to-end worked example:  

* [Efficient Frontier Portfolio Optimisation in Python](https://medium.com/python-data/effient-frontier-in-python-34b0c3043314)

Ricky's post is pretty awesome and he's made it very easy to understand what's going on in each step.

(and for the mathematician's out there - it's a pretty cool example of using a Monte Carlo simulation to solve a problem)
